# Matias Salaris - Master's Student in Computer Science

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã

I am Matias Salaris, a passionate computer science master's student, currently searching for a Software Engineer/Data Science job and for a thesis in the field of Machine Learning, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image analysis techniques. I am currently enrolled at the University of Milan, and I am taking a semester abroad in Copenhagen, exploring new perspectives in the world of computer science.

## About Me

- üéì **Education:** Master's in Computer Science, University of Milan
- üåç **Current Location:** Copenhagen (1 Semester Abroad)

## Research Interests

I am deeply interested in the following areas:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Exploring the power of language in machine learning applications.
- **Image Analysis:** Leveraging machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from images.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

1. **Predictor for Money Laundering Transactions**
   - Developed a model able to predict money laundering transaction with a good accuracy.
   - Python, Sklearn.
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/MatiasSalaris/AMD-SM2L-2022-23-project/tree/main).

2. **Replication of [Generalization without systematicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350) paper**
   - Replicated the implementation of Seq2Seq networks used in the paper and obtained similar results.
   - Python, Pytorch, Encoder-decoder networks (LSTMs and GRUs).
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/MatiasSalaris/SCAN_Replication/tree/main)

3. **Question Answering System for Arabic / Bengali / Indonesian*
   - Developed a Language model for each of the languages.
   - Developed a Question answering binary system (both through fine Tuning Bert models and by using TF-IDF to feed a SVM).
   - Developed a system that detect the span of the text in the document that actually contains the answer (using Attention mechanism).
   - Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy.
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/TokeReines/08_NLP/tree/main/examn).

Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to collaboration and learning new things!
