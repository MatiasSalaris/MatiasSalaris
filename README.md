# Matias Salaris - Master's Student in Computer Science

Welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã

I am Matias Salaris, a master's student specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a deep commitment to advancing language-based AI applications. I am actively pursuing job and research opportunities in NLP, with an emphasis on roles that blend software engineering, machine learning, and data science. Currently, I am completing my Master‚Äôs degree at the University of Milan, where my research is dedicated to NLP applications in media analytics.

## About Me

- üéì **Education:** Master's in Computer Science, University of Milan
- üåç **Current Location:** Milan, Italy

## Research Interests

I am deeply interested in the following areas:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Unlocking the complexities of human language to power smarter machine learning applications.
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how machine learning models make decisions, focusing on the internal mechanisms within NLP systems.
- **Sentiment and Bias Detection**: Developing algorithms to detect sentiment and identify potential biases in text, improving fair and objective analysis.
- **Multilingual NLP and Machine Translation**: Creating and improving systems that facilitate communication across languages and cultural contexts.

## Projects

**Current project **
I am working on my master‚Äôs thesis, which focuses on building a system to track and analyze the evolution of news articles across digital media platforms. This project is composed of two main modules:

Source Attribution and Propagation Tracking: Identifying the original sources of news articles and mapping how they spread across platforms.
Narrative Evolution Analysis: Examining shifts in narrative, tone, factual emphasis, and bias over time.

**Other Projects **
1. **Predictor for Money Laundering Transactions**
   - Developed a model able to predict money laundering transaction with a good accuracy.
   - Python, Sklearn.
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/MatiasSalaris/AMD-SM2L-2022-23-project/tree/main).

2. **Replication of [Generalization without systematicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350) paper**
   - Replicated the implementation of Seq2Seq networks used in the paper and obtained similar results.
   - Python, Pytorch, Encoder-decoder networks (LSTMs and GRUs).
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/MatiasSalaris/SCAN_Replication/tree/main)

3. **Question Answering System for Arabic / Bengali / Indonesian*
   - Developed a Language model for each of the languages.
   - Developed a Question answering binary system (both through fine Tuning Bert models and by using TF-IDF to feed a SVM).
   - Developed a system that detect the span of the text in the document that actually contains the answer (using Attention mechanism).
   - Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy.
   - [Git Repo](https://github.com/TokeReines/08_NLP/tree/main/examn).

Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to collaboration and learning new things!
